## Opposition

Who has opposition ? 

Same color = player that moves first is in disadvantage - loses opposition
Different color = player that moves first is in advantage

=> Odd distance => same color => First to move loses opposition
=> Even distance => First to move will make distance odd => loses opposition

If there is only one square between the two players:
2 types of opposition:
Frontal opposition
Lateral opposition
(Diagonal opposition) is a variation of the two.

If there are more than 2 squares between them - distant opposition. 

### SUMMARY:
Different colors => First too move is in advantage as he gains the opposition
Same color => First to move is in disadvantage as the position is already in opposition, so first to move will give way to the opponent.

## End game principles:
- always advance the side of the board that is in advantage
- first consider moving the knight towards the center of the board before anything else, or towards the passed pawn, if any
